# VB.Assessment
This is my solution for the assessment as requested.



A quick rundown:
-The Search controller is used to retrieve data from OMDB
-This then stores the requested data as per instruction in the databas.
-I am using mongoatlas so there is real time data to work with

For the admin controller:
-Most of the data is dated for the 3rd and 4th of July 2024.
-For any of the endpoints using a date use either the 3rd or the 4th


For the authorization controller:
-It is just a simple controller to retrieve an api key
-use the username admin

There are some unit tests. I ran out of time so could not add tests for all functionality.


I look forward to hearing your feedback.
